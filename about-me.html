  <h1>About me</h1>
  <hr/>
  <p> Hi, I'm Clay Fonseca, a software engineer and recent graduate from Louisiana Tech University. The world is a hectic place right now, so I'm thankful that I was able to get a job at TCS and leave home. This ILP has been my first exposure to frontend web development, since I've mostly worked in backend and data processing up till now. However, it's been interesting, and I think that it's very useful to have knowledge of all of the technologies used in a project so that one can understand not only how to work on their own segments of a project, but also how to better integrate their pieces into the project as a whole</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>Outside of work I enjoy gaming, spending time with friends, and the outdoors. Now, those are a little vague, so I'll elaborate. I probably spend a bit too much of my life playing League of Legends while ignoring the large number of games I've bought but not started. Unfortunately, most of my friends are from back in Louisiana and are still there while I moved to Arkansas, and while I can speak to them online, it's not really the same. Finally, I enjoy hiking the most out of any outdoor activity. Honestly, one of the biggest positives of moving to Arkansas is that, unlike Louisiana, there are places to hike that aren't swamps.</p>
